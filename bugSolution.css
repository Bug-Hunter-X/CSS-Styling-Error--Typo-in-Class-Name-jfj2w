The solution involves carefully checking the class name and correcting any typos. Ensure the class name in the CSS selector exactly matches the class name used in the HTML.

```css
.my-class {
  color: blue;
}
```

In this corrected version, `my-class` accurately reflects the intended class name, ensuring that the styles are applied successfully.
